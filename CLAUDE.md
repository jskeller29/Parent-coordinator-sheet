This is a Google Apps Script project (a Google Sheets add-on for student/roster management).
- .gs files are Apps Script server-side code (JavaScript that runs on Google's servers)
- .html files are dialog/sidebar UIs served via HtmlService
- Frontend HTML talks to backend .gs functions via google.script.run
- There is no build step and no modules — all .gs files share one global scope
